# Inventrom: My First Website 

This project is a simple, static website built entirely with **HTML** and **CSS**. It is designed to showcase the fundamentals of web development, including structuring content with HTML and styling it with CSS. The website features a clean, multi-section layout and visually appealing design elements, making it a great starting point for beginners.

The project includes:
- Organising website content using semantic HTML tags.
- Styling and layout using external CSS for separation of concerns.
- Clean, readable code for easy learning and customisation.
    
The goal of this website is to demonstrate how **HTML** and **CSS** can be used together to craft attractive, functional web pages without any JavaScript or backend technologies.
